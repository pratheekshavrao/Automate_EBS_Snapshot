# Automate EBS volume backup using Lambda

To mitigate potential data loss due to instance failures or errors, EBS volumes can be safeguarded through automated backups. This involves creating snapshots, a task that can be efficiently automated using AWS Lambda functions. By scheduling Lambda execution at specific intervals, the EventBridge service facilitates the automated backup process, ensuring the timely creation of snapshots to enhance data resilience and recovery measures.
